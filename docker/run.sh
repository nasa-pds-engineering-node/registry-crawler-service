# This script is used to start the Registry Crawler Service docker container with a simple command.
#
# Usage: ./run.sh
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update the following environment variables before executing this script

# Absolute path of the Registry Crawler Service configuration file in the host machine (E.g.: /tmp/cfg/crawler-server.cfg)
CRAWLER_SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/cfg/crawler-server.cfg

# Absolute path of the Harvest data directory in the host machine (E.g.: `/tmp/registry-harvest-data`).
# If the Registry Harvest CLI is executed with the option to download test data, then this directory will be
# cleaned-up and populated with test data. Make sure to have the same `HARVEST_DATA_DIR` value set in the
# environment variables of the Registry Harvest Service, Registry Crawler Service and Registry Harvest CLI.
# Also, this `HARVEST_DATA_DIR` location should be accessible from the docker containers of the Registry Harvest Service,
# Registry Crawler Service and Registry Harvest CLI.
HARVEST_DATA_DIR=/tmp/registry-harvest-data


# Check if the Registry Crawler Service configuration file exists
